Rough overview:
1. Train a model on labeled "emotion" face images.
2. Create a notebook that uses emotion/song key pairs to output songs when emotions are given.
3. Train a model on unlabeled music metadata to group like music.
4. Create a program that takes the initial input of video and feeds samples to Model A, which generates an input to our Table, which generates an input to Model B, which outputs a song!
